# Yo, what's up? 👋I'm **Karim**, your self-taught coding hustler, slinging code and building systems like a boss. If I had to put a label on myself, I'd say I'm a **System Developer**. I’m all about **making things work**—whether that’s in the backend, the middle, or the frontend, I’m down to code in any language. Well, except for those functional languages… I ain't about that life 😎.## My Stack? 🤔I ain't picky. If it runs on a computer, I’ll make it my tool. But I’ll tell you this—I'm all about **imperative** and **object-oriented** vibes. Give me C, Python, Java, or even a lil' C++ action, and I’m in. You want something fast and smooth? I'm there.## What I'm Into 🔥- 🔭 I'm currently building systems that scale.- 🌱 I’m diving deeper into cloud technologies and system architecture—making things bulletproof.- 💬 Hit me up if you need help building something from the ground up.- 🛠️ I break things, I fix things, and I make 'em better.- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m all about **functionality over flash**. But if it looks cool? Even better.## Let's Connect 🚀- 📫 You can hit me up anytime at: [karim@example.com](mailto:karim@example.com)- 🌐 Or check my projects out below and let’s vibe:### Projects:- [**Project 1**](https://github.com/karim/project1) – **Building some next-gen stuff**  - [**Project 2**](https://github.com/karim/project2) – **System automation like a pro**- [**Project 3**](https://github.com/karim/project3) – **It’s faster than you think**## Let's make this world run smoother, one line of code at a time. 💥
